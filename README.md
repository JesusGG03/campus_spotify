<h1>Campus Spotify</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Campus Spotify is a web-application that aims to collect user information around a centralized campus. Using the spotify API, users can login
and grant authorization. Users would have their top items displayed, similar to "Spotify Wrapped". A database would aggregate information and display
the campus's top items. This is the heart of this project. Users can compare their favorite songs or artists to the university's top items.
This brings a sense of exclusivity or superiority and could bring users back again and again.

ran on the phone because of how I plan to advertise it)



<h2>Technologies and Concepts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Language: HTML, CSS, Javascript</li>
  <li>Frameworks: Node.js</li>
  <li>Technologies: Heroku, PostgreSQL, Spotify API</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
This project served as both a learning experience and showcase of my HTML, CSS, and JS skills(albeit still learning). It emphasizes:
<ul>
  <li>Interacting with a thrid party API</li>
  <li>Pulling, manipulating, and pushing data into a postgreSQL</li>
  <li>Deploying a full stack project</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feature Checklist</h2>
This checklist is meant for features that are not fully imlplemented. <br>
<ul>
  <li>- [ ] Express routers for user data and university data (works appropriately, but new routers would imporve functionality)</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Experience</h2>
By far, the most exciting project I have built. Although learning a new framework while building this project proved to be a bit difficult, fixing bugs and have my project run successfully 
was extremely rewarding. On top of that, I had a lot of fun and learned a lot about deploying a web app. Really love how it came out.
I learned a lot about Node.js and its different modules that come with it. Night after Night solutions would come to be and fixing bugs wouldn't be hard.
