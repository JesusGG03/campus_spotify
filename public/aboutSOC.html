            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p><i>Sound of Charlotte</i> is a personal project that has been developed over
                the course of 3 weeks. The original concept of SOC was a basic, terminal-based,
                python project. However, as I kept working on it, I became more ambitious and wanted to deploy 
                my own web app.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>How It Works</h4>
            <p><i>Sound of Charlotte</i> works with the Spotify API. This API is what allows
            you to login and grant permission for this website to access your top tracks, artists, and genres.
            Additionally, none of your sensitive data is logged or stored. The only information that is stored
            is your top items, which also are stored with no connection to you. Lastly, <i>Sound of Charlotte</i>
            stores all the tracks, artists, and genres in a database with a count that accumulates if a song already
            exists in the database.
            </p>

            <p>p.s. The button to switch tracks, artists, and genres stops working
                after multiple clicks. This is a bug I encountered during my last 
                day of developing. I'm trying my hardest to find a solution. Thank you 
                for your patience!
            </p>

            <h4>What I learned</h4>
            <p>
                This project was extremely fun to build. As previously state, This project was supposed to be a terminal-based,
                python project. However, I thought it would be a really neat idea to let others compare their top songs with a
                university's top songs. This led to the change to a web app. Lastly, the biggest issue I have faced while making this
                was the button to switch to let a user see the university's data and user's data. Additionally, I faced issues deploy since this
                was my first progect that has been deployed. All in all, I learned a lot while making this and look forward to learning more!
